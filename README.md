The AI-Powered Home Companion Robot prototype I've created is called Vox.

The robot is currently capable of being manually controlled either by a keyboard or a controller, with future upcoming implementations of autonomous driving and vision recognition. It also has a ai voice assistant feature (done via openai api). More updates to come in the future.

BOM:

- Raspberry pi 4
- L298N Dual Motor Driver
- 2 x 12v DC Motors
- 3 x 18650 3.7v rechargeable batteries (for powering the motors)
- External battery (for powering the raspberry pi)
- Webcam (for future vision recognition features implementations)
- 3d printed robot case
- plexiglass chasis
- tft touchscreen display (for displaying facial expressions animations)
- speaker and webcam microphone (for ai voice assistant feature)
