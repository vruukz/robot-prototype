Vox – AI-Powered Home Companion Robot (Prototype)

The prototype I have developed is named Vox, an AI-powered home companion robot. At its current stage, Vox can be manually operated via either a keyboard or a controller. Future developments will include autonomous navigation and computer vision capabilities. Additionally, the robot features an AI voice assistant powered by the OpenAI API, enabling natural voice interaction.

Further enhancements and functionalities are planned for upcoming iterations.
